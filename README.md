# Project/lab_3
As for external library i used sfml for my project to create user interface. Program itself is a standart Sea Battle game.
With standart rules: every player have 4 ships with 1 deck , 3 with 2,2 with 3 and 1 with 4. They can place them on their 10x10 field in the way that none of ships are placed nearby. Then on each player's turn they can try to guess where is enemy ship by clicking on part of enemy fiel if they gues they get one more extra turn.
You can palce ships by just taking them from special place on screen or field and hovering over needed part of field.
Win player who first get out all of enemy ships.
