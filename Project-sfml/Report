In my program i used SFML to create simple application interface.
SFML handles creating and input to windows, and creating and managing OpenGL contexts.
My plan for this library was to create simple user interface to provide interaction of user actions and interface.
Specifically create well known game called Sea Battle.
I choose this library because some of my friends had experience of using it and recomended to me for my plans and all other alternatives like QT,Freeglut etc. 
were not looking so simple and understandable to use.
You can esay download this library from official website(https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and customize it using guide from this website.
Documentation of library provides usefull description of every methods and classes, when i was using it i don't need to look somewhere else very often.
Documentation link(https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/)
Names of methods and classe are intuitively understandable, even for me while using this library for the first time.
There are quite a lot of extra code because all algorithmic and other methods i implemented by myself not using this library.
I understood clearly how my code works with library methods and how they work with themselfs. That simplify what i need to do a lot.
Actually one of the main problem was not really connected with library, that was finding proper textures for sprites in program.
So I have spent a lot of time finding them and then correcting them.
In general SFML left positive feelings after using it, main reason is lack of infinite amount of issues.
If i will need to write similar programs in future, i will more likely use SfML then won't. As for way of using library
for now i don't see library features that i could use to simplify my work, or just upgrade code.
